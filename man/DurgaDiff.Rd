  x,
  data.col,
  group.col,
  id.col,
  groups,
  contrasts = "*",
  effect.type = "mean",

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame (or similar) containing values to be compared, or a
formula (see \code{\link{DurgaDiff.formula}}).}

\item{...}{Ignored}

\item{data.col}{Name (character) or index (numeric) of the column within
\code{x} containing the measurement data.}

\item{group.col}{Name or index of the column within \code{x} containing
the values to group by. May be a vector of column names/indices, in
which case values from each column are concatenated to define groups.}

\item{id.col}{Specify for paired data/repeated measures/with-subject
comparisons only. Name or index of ID column for repeated measures/paired
data. Observations for the same individual must have the same ID. For
non-paired data, do not specify an \code{id.col}, (or use \code{id.col =
  NA}).}

\item{groups}{Vector of group names. Defaults to all groups in \code{x} in
\emph{natural} order. If \code{groups} is a named vector, the names are
used as group labels for plotting or printing. If \code{data.col} and
\code{group.col} are not specified, \code{x} is assumed be to in \emph{wide
format}, and \code{groups} must be a list of column names identifying the
group/treatment data (see example).}

\item{contrasts}{Specify the pairs of groups to be compared. By default, all
pairwise differences are generated. May be a single string, a vector of
strings, or a matrix. Specify
\code{NULL} to avoid calculating any contrasts. See Details for more information.}

\item{effect.type}{Type of group difference to be estimated. Values cannot be
abbreviated. See Details for further information.}

\item{R}{The number of bootstrap replicates. \code{R} should be larger than
your sample size, so the default value of 1000 may need to be increased for
large sample sizes. If \code{R <= nrow(x)}, an error such as "\code{Error in
  bca.ci... estimated adjustment 'a' is NA}" will be thrown. Additionally,
warnings such as "\code{In norm.inter(t, adj.alpha) : extreme order
  statistics used as endpoints}" may be avoided by increasing \code{R}.
Specify \code{R = NA} if you do not wish to calculate any CIs, either
for group means for for effect sizes. This may be useful if Durga is
only being used for plotting large data sets.}

\item{boot.params}{Optional list of additional names parameters to pass to
the \code{\link[boot]{boot}} function.}

\item{ci.conf}{Numeric confidence level of the required confidence interval,
e.g. \code{ci.conf = 0.95} specifies that 95\\% confidence intervals should
be calculated. Applies to both CI of effect sizes and CI of group means.}

\item{boot.ci.params}{Optional list of additional names parameters to pass to
the \code{\link[boot]{boot.ci}} function.}

\item{na.rm}{a logical evaluating to TRUE or FALSE indicating whether NA
values should be stripped before the computation proceeds. If \code{TRUE}
for "paired" data (i.e. \code{id.col} is specified), all rows
(observations) for IDs with missing data are stripped.}
}

as set by the \code{ci.conf} parameter) and \code{n} (group sample size).
If there are fewer than 3 distinct values in the group, or if \code{R} is
\code{NA}, the confidence interval will not be calculated and
\code{CI.lower} and \code{CI.upper} will be \code{NA}.}

\item{\code{group.differences}}{List of \code{DurgaGroupDiff} objects,
which are \code{boot} objects with added confidence interval information.

\item{\code{groups}}{Vector of group names}
\item{\code{group.names}}{Labels used to identify groups}
\item{\code{effect.type}}{Value of \code{effect.type} parameter}
\item{\code{effect.name}}{Name of the effect type; may include formatting
such as subscripts} \item{\code{effect.name.print}}{Text-only version of
\code{effect.name} for printing; subscripts are indicated by \code{"_"}}

were estimated}
\item{\code{data}}{The input data frame (\code{x}), or the reshaped (long format) data
frame if the input data set was in wide format}
\item{\code{call}}{How this function was called}

A \code{DurgaGroupDiff} object is a \code{boot} object (as returned by
\code{\link[boot]{boot}}) with added \code{bootci} components (as returned
by \code{\link[boot]{boot.ci}}) and components identifying the groups used
to estimate the difference. Particularly relevant members are:

\item{\code{t0}}{The observed value of the statistic}
\item{\code{bca[4]}}{The lower endpoint of the confidence interval}
\item{\code{bca[5]}}{The upper endpoint of the confidence interval}

\details{
\subsection{Data format}{

\code{x} may be a formula; see \code{\link{DurgaDiff.formula}}.

If \code{x} is a \code{data.frame} (or similar) it may be in either \emph{long} or \emph{wide}
format. In long format, one column (\code{data.col}) contains the measurement or value to be
compared, and another column (\code{group.col}) contains the group identity. Repeated
measures/paired data/within-subject comparisons in long format require a subject
identity column (\code{id.col}).

Wide format contains different measurements in different columns of the same row, and
is well-suited for repeated measures/paired/within-subject comparison data. To pass
wide format data, do not specify the arguments \code{data.col} or
\code{group.col}. Instead, you must explicitly specify the groups to be
compared in the \code{groups} argument. Each group must be the name of a
column in \code{x}. For paired data, you may specify \code{id.col}, although it is not
required, as wide format data is assumed to be paired. The \code{id.col} can be a column
that already exists and uniquely identifies each specimen, or it can be the name of a
column to be created, in which case the specimen ID will be a generated integer sequence.
Unpaired data can be in wide format, but it is necessary to inform Durga by passing \code{id.col = NULL}.
Wide format data will be internally converted to long format, then processing continues as
for long format input.
}

\subsection{Contrasts}{

The pairs of groups to be compared are defined by the parameter
\code{contrasts}. An asterisk (\code{"*"}, the default) creates contrasts for
all possible pairs of groups. A single string has a format such as
\code{"group1 - group2, group3 - group4"}. A single string such as \code{".-
control"} compares all groups against the \code{"control"} group, i.e. the
\code{"."} expands to all groups except the named group. A vector of strings
looks like \code{c("group1 - group2", "group3 - group4")}. If a matrix is
specified, it must have a column for each contrast, with the first group in
row 1 and the second in row 2.
}

\subsection{Effect types}{

The \code{effect.type} parameter determines the effect size measure to be
calculated. Our terminology generally follows Lakens (2013), with \emph{d} meaning
a biased estimate and \emph{g} meaning a bias-corrected estimate. Some writers
reverse this usage or use alternative terminology. Cumming (2012) recommends
always using a bias-corrected estimate (although bias
correction is unnecessary for large sample sizes).
Durga applies Hedges' exact method for bias correction.

The effect type we call
\eqn{Cohen's\text{ }d} for unpaired data is called \eqn{Cohen's\text{ }d_s^*}
by Delacre et al. (2021). For paired data, our \eqn{Cohen's\text{ }d} is
identical to \eqn{Cohen's\text{ }d}
for unpaired data (Delacre et al. 2021); it is called \eqn{d_{av}}
by Cumming (2012; equation 11.10). For further details, refer to Khan and McLean (2023).

The set of possible values for the \code{effect.type} argument, and
their meanings, is described below.

}


As a simple rule of thumb, if you want a standardised effect type and you
don't know which one to use, use \code{"hedges g"} for either paired or unpaired data,
as it is recommended by Delacre et al., (2021) for unpaired data and cumming (2012)
for paired data.

Additional effect types can be applied by passing a function for
\code{effect.type}. The function must accept two
parameters and return a single numeric value, the effect size.
Each parameter is a vector of values from one of the two groups to be
compared (group 2 and group 1).

\subsection{Confidence intervals}{

Confidence intervals for the estimate are determined using bootstrap
resampling, using the adjusted bootstrap percentile (BCa) method (see
\code{\link[boot]{boot}} and \code{\link[boot]{boot.ci}}). Additional
arguments can be passed to the \code{\link[boot]{boot}}
(\code{\link[boot]{boot.ci}}) by passing a named list of values as the
argument \code{boot.params} (\code{boot.ci.params}).
